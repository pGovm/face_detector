# Kanye West Face Detector

## Introduction
I started this project to learn Python better and how to make a custom object detection model. I started by scrapping the internet for pictures of Kanye West using Image Downloader. I then used Microsoft Power Toys to rename all of the images to a sequential name without spaces and change the resolution of all of the images. I then used Label Studio to annotate over 600 pictures and exported the images. I accidentally exported the images incorrectly, so I created a few string manipulation scripts to fix the formatting. I finally trained the images using the imageai python module. In the end, my model has a 75% accuracy with room to improve in more challenging photos.
